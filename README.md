##The importance

The internet continues to grow and has become the default point of call for businesses and individuals searching for goods, services or information. For businesses wishing to get that competitive advantage, a multilingual website now presents one of the highest impact means of expanding a client base and securing greater sales volumes. The multilingual website will continue becoming necessity for businesses and organisations as the process of internationalization unfolds. In a globalised world where technology is of paramount importance, your multilingual website can enable you to sell your products all over the world.

##What you can be missing

If you live in an English-speaking country, you may not have considered adding multilingual content to your site. However, webmasters are increasingly recognising the importance of including content that appeals to a global audience, and which addresses them in their mother-tongue languages. After all, just 27% of Internet users are English speaking according to the World Internet Statistics. Moreover, a study carried out by the Common Sense Advisory found that a massive 85% of online shoppers would only purchase from websites that discussed the products in their own language even if they were able to understand other languages used on the site.

##Grow your sales

With every popular language added to a website there is potential for an increase of up to 100% in sales. There is potentially a 400% increase in sales thanks to translating the website into just few world major languages i.e. Spanish, French, German, and Italian.

##The solution

The importance of targeting non-English speakers is clear, but incorporating other languages into your site seems to be a mammoth task.
